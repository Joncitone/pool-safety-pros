    <h4>Welcome to the home of Pool Safety Pros, we provide quality equipment to secure pool areas, saving the lives of children, loved ones, and pets!</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Pool fences and nets by Pool Safety Pros. are easy-to-use removable barriers that provide a dependable and aesthetically pleasing layer of safety for your pool or spa. Pool Safety Pros. fencing is made of durable transparent mesh fabric held by aircraft-grade aluminum poles. Pool Safety Pros. pool nets are special covers made from ultra-strong polyethylene twine that children cannot crawl under or fall through. Both barrier types can be easily removed (by adults only) and rolled up for compact storage.
        A pool safety fence and swimming pool cover from Pool Safety Pros. help ensure that your pool is the site of personal relaxation and family bonding, not preventable water accidents. We also supply leaf pool covers that help keep water free of windblown debris and assist with reducing the need to skim the pool frequently.</p>
